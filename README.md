## 🧠 Built By

**Owais** — aspiring front-end developer & creative problem solver.

> This wasn’t easy — and it wasn’t meant to be. But I loved every bit of it.  
After building a C version of this store (with no visuals), I wanted to bring it to life as a real website.  
Instead of falling into tutorial hell, I challenged myself to code it from scratch — only using AI when I truly needed help understanding a function or how `localStorage` worked.  

Around **90–95% of the code** is mine.  
The CSS styling was handled by AI since I’m focused more on becoming a **JavaScript/React developer** than a designer. I see myself either going toward **React/React Native** or possibly **Node.js** in the future.

This project helped me learn by doing what I love — and that’s how I get better.

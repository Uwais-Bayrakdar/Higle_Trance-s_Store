I would like to say first of all this wasn't easy, it never was meant to be easy, but i loved doing this project, and i wanted it to be reality so bad, after doing the C project version of it (the first version), I liked it, but didn't like that there's no visaulity in it, so i decided to make it a website also, this is how i get better in coding, by doing the things i love as a challenge and not go to tutorial hell, although i definetly wasn't alone doing this, i was using ai, but only for logical things, about 90 to 95% of the code is from me, and the other 10-5% was from stuff i wasn't been able to do it alone, just because i lacked info about the function or localStorage, so yeah, i wasn't alone, and to be honest, i was doing the functional part only, i did let ai make the css part, just because i'm not thinking of becoming a web designer, nor do i hear about a functional website builder being a web designer also (it's rare), in a company i would either go to backend (will learn in the future), or javascript frameworks (most likely react/react native or node.js).
